# Software-Requirements-Analysis
This class was developed to improve our critical thinking skills in business analysis and software requirements.

These documents were produced solely for learning purposes and will not be used for actual business application.
Overall opinion of the course is that it is engaging and exciting. I wish to get better at writing these kind of documents and enhance my analysis skills to produce better results.
